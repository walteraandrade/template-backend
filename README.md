# Template Backend

This is a repository made for studying concepts and funcionality of backend services.
It's primarily built on top of Node.JS, without any libraries, the idea is to go further building the best backend services I can without using them.
Then, starting adding libraries while trying to understand the problems each of these solves and what they actually do behind the curtains.

##### Patterns for development

- All file names must follow the following pattern: <module name>.<function in the app>.<extension>;
- All file names and folders are written in kebab case, but folders should avoid composed names;
